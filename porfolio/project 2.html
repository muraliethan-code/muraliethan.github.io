<h1>Global Inequality: Progress and Challenges in Reducing Disparities</h1>

<p>Economic inequality continues to be a significant global issue, affecting millions of people across different regions. <br>While progress has been made in narrowing income gaps, challenges remain in ensuring equitable growth and eliminating social barriers. <br>Incomes of the poorest 40% of the population have generally increased at a faster rate than the national average in many countries, aided by financial transfers during the pandemic. <br>However, disparities between the richest and poorest nations have widened over the past five years. Additionally, persistent discrimination based on factors such as age, gender, religion, race,<br> and belief affects one in six people globally, reinforcing social inequality.</p>

<p>Regional disparities in income growth further illustrate the uneven progress in reducing economic inequality. <br><mark>Data indicates that the bottom 40% of earners in 78% of Northern American and European countries have experienced faster income growth than the national average.<br>Conversely, only 30% of countries in Central and Southern Asia have achieved similar progress.</mark> <br>Despite financial transfers providing relief during the pandemic, long-term solutions require strategic policies to sustain inclusive prosperity and reduce income disparities across regions.</p>
